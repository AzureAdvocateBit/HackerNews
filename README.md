# HackerNews

A Xamarin.Forms app for displaying the top posts on Hacker News.

This app uses the [Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language) from [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/machine-learning/) to analyze the sentiment of each headline. If a headline is happy, 😃 will appear. If a headline is sad, ☹️ will appear. If a headline is neither happy nor sad, 😐 will appear.
